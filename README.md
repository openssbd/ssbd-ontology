# SSBD-Ontology

Lead developer: Yuki Yamagata (RIKEN R-IH and RIKEN BRC)

SSBD Ontology is a two-tier model for FAIR metadata of bioimaging. The repository layer captures the minimum information required for rapid, DOI-based release of image datasets, while the added-value layer enriches the same instances with detailed biological context (organism, strain, cell/cell-line, anatomy, GO terms) and imaging provenance (imaging method, instrument, OME-Zarr links). SSBD Ontology re-uses and aligns with OBO Foundry ontologies— ChEBI, CL, CLO, UBERON, GO, FBbi, OBI, IAO—so that multi scale data information can be integrated uniformly.
